Using a genetic algorithm to optimize supply chain decisions

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program (in both .ipynb and .py fomat) that explores
how effective various genetic and natural algorthims are at finding an optimal or near
optimal solution for supply chain decisions. Specifially, we wish to minimize the cost
of supplying goods to a set of retail locations given a set of factory/warehouse locations.
Demand by item-type and straight line distance drive the cost function used for optimization.
